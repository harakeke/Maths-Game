Install a module that serves static files. Static files are usualluy .html .css .js files and images. 
Expressjs already comes with a module for doing this.
We need to create a folder for storing our file in. Let's call this one public. In the public folder we also create sub folders for "css", "image" and "js".
We also want to put an index.html file in the public folder. This is the file that will be served we a browser is requesting "/".
